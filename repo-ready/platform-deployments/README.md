# Platform Deployments

This repo is the Kubernetes deployment source for the repo-ready NutriTrack split.

The intended production flow is same-origin traffic through Envoy Gateway:

- frontend is just another microservice
- frontend calls `/api/...` on the same host
- Envoy Gateway routes `/` to frontend and `/api/*` to backend services
- backend services do not need CORS for this deployment model

## Layout

- `values.yaml`: single global Helm values file for the full platform
- `secrets/`: plain Kubernetes Secret manifests you can convert to SealedSecrets later
- `microservices/`: per-service Helm charts
- `infrastructure/postgresql/`: shared PostgreSQL chart
- `infrastructure/envoy-gateway/`: Gateway API resources with backend refs driven from `values.yaml`
- `infrastructure/bootstrap/`: namespace bootstrap manifest reference
- `raw-k8s/`: plain manifest reference copies
- `scripts/deploy.sh`: installs the stack into a kubeadm or any CNCF Kubernetes cluster
- `scripts/build-images.sh`: optional helper that builds images from sibling repo-ready service folders

## Expected Repo Split

When you split `repo-ready/` into independent repositories, keep this repo as the place where:

- image repositories and tags are managed
- namespace, gateway, and shared infra are managed
- inter-service backend references stay consistent

## Deploy

1. Push service images to a registry and update `values.yaml`.
2. Replace every placeholder value under `secrets/`.
3. Convert those Secret manifests to SealedSecrets later if you want, but keep the same secret names from `values.yaml`.
4. Install Gateway API and Envoy Gateway in the cluster if they are not already present.
5. Run `./scripts/deploy.sh <namespace>`.

The deploy script creates the namespace, applies the plain Secret manifests, installs PostgreSQL, deploys all backend services, deploys the frontend, and then installs the Envoy Gateway routing resources.

For Kubernetes, the service Secret examples use the PostgreSQL StatefulSet primary host `postgresql-0.postgresql` because PostgreSQL now runs behind a headless Service.
